# Deep-Monocular-Visual-Odometry
A mixture of traditional with new techniques for Visual Odometry and SLAM


~~Weird pipeline, not really working atm:~~

~~1. Feature matching (AKAZE).
2. 3D monocular estimation. 2D keypoints to 3D.
~~3. SolvePnP to get translation and rotation vector.
4. Add to initial position.
~~5. Repeat.


As said it needs a good debugging to make it work. Also a profound understanding of the matter.
